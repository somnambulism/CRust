# Elementary C Compiler Written in Rust

Inspired by [nqcc2](https://github.com/nlsandler/nqcc2)

Hello, drugalyok!

It is a very simple C compiler written in Rust. It still requires [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for its
operation to build an executable from assembly language code. And to preprocess
the source code into C...

**Important**:

- I don't know the Rust programming language very well, so this code
  may look like shit to a professional.
- Tested on Windows only.

## Usage

(On Windows, it is preferable to use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

1. Download and install [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/). (And now you have a C language compiler. I don't know why you need anything else...)
2. Download and install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
3. Clone this repo.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/somnambulism/CRust.git
   ```
4. Go to the project folder and build the project.
   ```
   cd CRust
   cargo build
   ```
5. Create a C source code file containing a single `main` function that returns an integer value:
   ```C
   int main(void) {
       return 2;
   }
   ```
6. Save this file, for example, to `sources/example.c`.
7. Compile the program!

   ```bash
   (Windows)
   ./target/debug/CRust.exe sources/example.c

   (Linux)
   ./target/debug/CRust sources/example.c
   ```

8. Run the compiled binary and enjoy your exit code:

   ```bash
   (Windows)
   $ ./sources/example.exe
   $ echo $?
   2

   (Linux)
   $ ./sources/example
   $ echo $?
   2
   ```

## Features Implemented to Date

- Compilation of the main function containing a single operator `return <int>`. üòê
- Support of unary operators `-` (negate) and `~` (bitwise not), may be combined using parentheses: `return -(~4);`
- Support of binary operators now you can compile programs like this one:
  ```C
  int main(void) {
      return 60 + 2 * (4 - 6 / 3);
  }
  ```
  - Extra: support of bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `^`) and shifts (`<<`, `>>`).
- Support of relational and logical operators:
  ```C
  int main(void) {
      return (0 == 0 && 3 == 2 + 1 > 1) + 1;
  }
  ```
- Local variables:
  ```C
  int main(void) {
      int a = 4;
      int b = a + 1;
      a = b - 5;
      return a + b;
  }
  ```
  - Extra: compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=` etc.) and increment/decrement (`++`, `--`).
    The code for increment/decrement is ugly, needs to be refactored (but I won't).
- `if` statements and conditional expression (ternary `expression ? expression : expression`).
   - Extra: labels and `goto` operator.
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
   - Extra: `switch` statements
